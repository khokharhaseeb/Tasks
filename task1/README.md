Text Extraction from Images by Optical Character Recognition models

 OCR models are provided with images and model will recognize the text and try to extract the text.
 we have three different models in our repository which we have to download and import first.

1) Meth1

 In this model we used the python library of pytesseract.
 It will extract the text by using its weights.
 We have used OS library to extract the path of the folder and list
 of the images to process it.

2) Meth2

 In this technique we have used EasyOcr model Weights to recognize text in cnic.
 This model will used already present weights to extract the text.
 We have used OS library to extract the path of the folder and list of the images to process it.

3) Meth3

 In this model we used the Craft Model Weights.
 It will extract the text by using its weights
 We have used OS library to extract the path of the folder
