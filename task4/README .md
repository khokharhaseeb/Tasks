# Bounding boxes with vertices and Image joining with pill and cv2
This project contains two files:
##  Bounding boxes Tasks
In bounding boxes task i am making boxes around the text with the help of json file given on specific image and then extract the text and write it on it
##  Image joining by Open-cv and pill
In this file i am joing two images after loading with pill and cv2
the difference is that pill also focus on orientation but cv2 just take pixels
so when we join by pill then videos will be inverted so in order to resolve this issue we will use Imageops from PILL and then use transpose function to orient it correctly and 
then we will have same results    
    
 ```bash  
git clone https://github.com/khokharhaseeb/Tasks.git
cd flask_ocr/Opencv
```
